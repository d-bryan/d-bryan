## üöÄ About Me

I am Dylan Bryan, a **Full-Stack Developer** with a love for the back end. Lately I have become obsessed withI am currently working on my Data Science and Machine Learning skills and am looking for a job in the tech industry. I recently graduated from the University of Maryland Global Campus with a Bachelors in **Computer Science and Engineering**.

The front end library that I have the most experience with is **React**, but I am working on gathering more experience with Angular and Vue. I have also recently gained experience working with **Typescript**, which I rather enjoy.

## Plan of Action to Work Toward Goals

My goal over the next month is to become proficient in all the major MVC tech stacks that implement server-side programming languages. The big ones would be:

- Java using Quarkus and Docker with Vue as the client UI   
    - Enterprise grade web application mimicking a business
- Python with Django and Wagtail 
    - Administrative CMS geared toward specific feature (Perhaps a Specific SaaS)
- PHP with Laravel and Drupal 
    - Blog style web application to mimic typical use case
- Ruby with Rails 
    - Committing time to assist in the development of devdocs.io, as it has 
    helped me out temendously when I needed it
    
  I plan to put this all together using microservices and Docker to the best of my abilities, while working to intergrate the applications to demonstrate a real world use case. Kubernetes, Docker and Docker hub will play a large role in this.
